Overarching Goal: send out all of my 16S samples for sequencing by May 2025

**charge sequenicing to sea of change grant (5K to spend in sequening by june)**


Step-by-step
1. rework 1st PCR for older samples which may have less DNA ~1 week
2. decide how to randomize the samples/ if the old samples need a different master mix than the new samples
3. work through the first PCR + pooling for 96 samples ~ 3 weeks
	1. starting at 7 samples at a time then 15 samples at a time
4. **Indexing Day!!!** 
5. 
6. send first batch out for sequencing yippeee!
7. Repeat 3-5 for the rest of the set
	1. at least 3 sequencing cycles left ~9 weeks left
