- Testing pipettes. The ratio of MW and volume of water is 1:1 g:mL therefore you can easily use this as a tool to check to see if your pipettes are set to the correct volume. 
	- Fill a beaker of water and put a weight boat on a scale
	- Tare the scale before each measurement
	- Set your pipette to desired volume
	- Pipette water onto the scale with that volume
	- Does the number on the scale correspond to the volume you have on your pipette
		- i.e. 1 mL of water should equal 1 g on the scale
