I appreciate that the authors edited this paper in a way that better demonstrates the importance of this baseline work of identifying the symbiont and microbial compositions and diversity among these corals. They also edited the introduction well, as to better showcase the aims of their study. However, the paper should be revised to create a better outline for this study to be reproducible in other contexts.

Lines-77-83 I appreciate that they described the different traits of coral species

Line 89 different font is used

line 108, I am confused with the wording of this, is the parenthesis necessary?

line 179, although we asked about the bioinformatics (unequal trimming of reads) I am still confused why reads from each species were trimmed differently for 16S


line 258 "PERMANOVA" not "PREMANOVA"

Bacterial Community Patterns
why not discuss the differences between sites in bacterial community patterns?
