Lines-77-83 I appreciate that they described the different traits of coral species

Line 89 different font is used

line 108, I am confused with the wording of this, is the parenthesis necessary?

The aims of this study are outlined very well in the intro!

For some reason I still cannot view figure 3

line 258 "PERMANOVA" not "PREMANOVA"

This paper did a wonderful job at writing about their science so as to make it reproducable in other contexts

I loved how to discussion illuded back to the stress tolerance of D. trenchii

In fact, a number of studies exploring the microbiome of _P. acuta_ and how it responds to new environments when transplanted indicate that it is strongly influenced by and quickly conforms to local conditions [62â€“64]. 
**awesome!**
