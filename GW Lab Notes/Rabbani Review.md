Notes for me
- read reference 12 to learn more about microbial conformers and regulators
- line 114 why transfer to -80?
- same 16S primers we use Â Caporaso et al. (2011)
- read reference 26 to learn about the two step protocol for ITS2 amp
- "noted that rDNA copy number in _Cladocopium_ can be five times higher than _Durusdinium_, therefore Symbiodiniaceae diversity metrics"
- clustering by species? still cluster by species when disease/bleaching is introduced?
- line 242, P. acuta is primarly composed of D1 ITS2 prfiles in 3/4 sites, thats why there is clustering of 3/4 sites on community structuring map
- relative abundance bar graph
- refernce 70, the Caribbean has more symbiodinicaea species than indo-pacific
- _Pseudoalteromonas_ (ASV 7) and _Vibrio_ (ASVs 1 & 3) are associated with many coral hosts, role in microbiome function??

questions
- line 340, but is Mataking actually more diverse in symbiont community? fig 4?


Edits
- line 92 need an ending parenthesis 
-  line 107 saying Corals were collected sounds like entire corals 
- line 132, what does briefly mean in this case?
- line 163 why chnage the default settings for the reads?
- line 171, i like the explaination of quality control!
- figure 3 is blank?
- line 224 what is community structuring? 
	- fig 4, when site is the variable and it is separated by species, what is actually being measured with the community? is it the diversity of microbes by site? why is mataking such a more spread out community?
-  line 334 could delete "here"
- line 336 where is the citation of the Coral Triangle diversity hotspot
