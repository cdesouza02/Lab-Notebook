Feedback on Brookes presentation 
1- no notes, 
SCTLD
Microbiome- different transitition- discuss how they all function together first
	maybe add words, difficult to follow at times
Methods- no notes
Metagenomes- good explanation of sus vs res
results- good transition to MCAV and PSTR
community similiarity- different sites? 
algal species- reexplain?, physically highlight the focal species
