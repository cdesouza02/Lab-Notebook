Summer 2025
- move unfiltered pipette tips? keep some for undergrads doing oyster stuff (next inventory?)
- coding hour, where people can bring their ideas/ issues to chat about 

Jul 21-24
- [ ] mail out sequences


Jul 14-18
**make sure that the samples stay the same through indexing, that way one barcode has the same sample just ITS2 vs 16S**
- [x] meeting with sarah (tues)
	- talk about pooling 16S and ITS2
		- from the concentrations calculate molarity based on the length of the regions including primers 
	- reading a paper on psba/sanger sequencing with branae this week
	- ~~belize concur~~
		- ~~just delete it~~
	- pls send me the indexing primer sheets (log in via buyways)
- [x] indexing day (read above) Wed
- [ ] sample purification and qubit (thurs)
- [ ] pool ITS2 based on qubit and pool with 16S (fri)
	- share calculations with sarah thurs

Jul 7-11
- [x] 15 ITS2 pcr (mon)
- [x] send sarah resume and draft email (mon)
- [x] make more tbe buffer (mon)
- [x] branae to requbit her negative just in case she pulled from the wrong tube 
	- label collection tubes as well 
	- do an extraction with 3 negatives 
- [ ] mentoring meeting
	- have them figure out how long things take 
		- personal data on their work efficiency 
	- trying things is an accomplishment, even if they don't work
	- revisit mentoring agreement 
- [x] 15 ITS2 pcr (wed)

- [x] send leah all things to be ordered (sun)
	- scuba pro
	- NEB
- [x] onboarding forms (mon)
- [x] ITS2 pcr (mon)
- [x] compile PsbA info for branae (mon)
- [x] meeting with sophie
- [ ] meeting with sarah (wed)
	- progress on ITS2
	- order psba primers (universal commonly used for Breviolium-CNAT) for branae/ chat about her plans and timeline
		- she'll only be here through july might be best to prioritize dna extractions since she has time for those 
		- but I can also see a benefit for having a set of sequences to learn how to analyze through the semester
		- she should be extracting EtOH
	- cali trip in late july 
	- fulbright updates 
- [x] ITS2 pcr (wed)
- [x] set up primer order with branae, breviolum and durusdinium (wed)
- [ ] 15 ITS2 pcr (thurs)

- [x] read mentoring paper (fri)
 - [ ] friday- independent research on where to study- use my notes from thurs
 - [ ] saturday- first draft of short answers :)
 


June 9-12
- [x] mail out vortex (mon)
- [x] read tristin paper (mon)

	- do I have to have a GIC account even if I have insurance through my parents and am under 26?
- [ ] emailing people 
	- interesting in a technician role/masters 
	- read career development article 
- [ ] make lists of people that I want to reach out to
	- ~~if brooke and nikea are talking to anyone at the confrence that is looking for a tech or a masters student~~
