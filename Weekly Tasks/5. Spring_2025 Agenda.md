		1. ~~NEB recommends 1.25 uL primer, should I try 1 uL to save (primer dimer with 1.25 also migth be excessive)~~
		2. Lajueness used 0.5 ng (2.5 uL) extracted dna. does this mean his concentrations were around 0.2? ours are better than that. if so I think we can standardize 1 ul of dna 
			1. Q5 requires DNA template of 0.5ng-0.5ug for 25 ul rxn\
			2. 1:10 dilution for samples above 100
			3. if the sample is under 5 add 2-3 ul DNA

	- elution buffer (Reagent grade water, TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, or TE buffer) **which reagent to elute?** use leftover from dna extraction kit
	-  look at the ampure bead that we have 
		- ratio of beads will change the size you select for 1.5x will get rid of larger primer dimers
		- confirm bulldog bio manufacturer protocol
- [ ] organize ITS2 protocol
	- Hume papers from symportal

	- 30 mins- abstract 
	- 30 mins- order gel purification kit, 16S cleaning questions, 
		- quanitfying out libraries using qubit? since we are doing gel purification does that mean that we won't need to confirm library size?

	 2. run it on a gradient that starts at a different annealing temp for each one
	 3. (this would be a great time to try out the lab-made master mix)
- [x] touch base with sarah tomorrow or monday
	1. ~~rerun indexed gel (FRI)~~
	2. look at primers and Tm calculator on NEB website  (FRI) 
	https://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/main
		 1. should we make any adjustments

	- https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0493-q5-hot-start-high-fidelity-dna-polymerase?srsltid=AfmBOop80Al7wMCSK6y6nmUCLZZfeSuqbIcTtPuc1MkG7ohY6MMFtwkQ
	- making hot start master mix using this? we have 5 kits for 500 rxns each 
	- buying 500 rxns of pre-made master mix is $1000+
	- **protocol for making master mix** https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2012/08/30/pcr-using-q5-hot-start-high-fidelity-dna-polymerase-m0493
	- makes 1x master mix, this one is 2x, should I make 2x mm
- also i made a game time decision to index 72 samples instead of 96 (we had the 100 rxn vial and had already used some for index tests and running through the protocol once)
- NEB doesn't recommend comparing PCR with premade mastermix and our mastermix 
	- if i make 2x mastermix and compared them I could use 1.5 kits to finish my samples
	- if not I could 1 kit (with 1x MM) or 2 kits (2x MM)
- [x] send pics of the kit we use for the first PCR
