LONG TERM 
- [x] read through sampling readme

	- R2_B3 have been labelled 
- [x] compile 96 in first PCR 
	-  then move on to indexing 96 at a time
- [ ] connecting zotero to obsidian
	- collecting summaries or key words of papers that apply to me
	- make it more easy to find papers to reference as I write my intro

Apr 3-4
- [ ] outline abstract for CERF
- [ ] **with sarah**
	- look at changing inhibitors in first pcr MM for the 9 i need to redo 
	- gel purification


Mar 23-Apr 1
- [x] optimizing gel
	- look into styrofoam box to block more light for UV
	-  put gels in the fridge
	- why do we use 0.5X TBE to run gels- use both at 1x
		- the reason to use tbe is bc its better at running things at higher voltage
- [x] optimizing PCR
	- annealing temp test samples at 67
- [ ] purify 96 samples and qubit them  
	- **AxyPrep Mag** can i use AmPure?
	- 7. Dispense **200 L** of 70% ethanol to each well of the reaction plate and incubate for 30 seconds **200 uL?**
	- elution buffer (Reagent grade water, TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, or TE buffer) **which reagent to elute?**
	-  look at the ampure bead that we have 
		- ratio of beads will change the size you select for 1.5x will get rid of larger primer dimers
- [ ] organize ITS2 protocol
	- Hume papers from symportal 
- [x] gel extraction kit
	- ask nikea 
	- https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/dna-clean-up/qiaquick-gel-extraction-kit

	- how to be reimbursed for the meals $58 per day
	- concur sponsored funds code/spending money while in Panama
 - [x] **fill out field goal setting** (FMA slack chat)
- [x] test out a gradient of annealing temps 
	- WHICH THERMOCYCLER DO I USE Bio-Rad 
	 1. set up a few of the ones that didn't work this time 
	 2. run it on a gradient that starts at a different annealing temp for each one
	 3. (this would be a great time to try out the lab-made master mix)
- [x] touch base with sarah tomorrow or monday
	1. ~~rerun indexed gel (FRI)~~
	2. look at primers and Tm calculator on NEB website  (FRI) 
	https://tmcalculator.neb.com/#!/main
		 1. should we make any adjustments
- [x] Primer diultions
	- ITS2 100 uM -> 10 uM
	- 16S 10 uM
- [ ] meeting with sarah
	- look over abstract outline for CERF
		- narrowed down to 4 sessions
	- confirm next steps for PCR
	- moving on with ITS2

March 10-14
- [x] concur submission
- [x] finish 96 samples 
- [x] redo PCR 10 samples that didn't work, or PCR 10 next samples on random list (Tues morning)
- [x] pooling! (tues after lunch)
- [x] indexing >:(
	- https://www.neb.com/en-us/products/m0493-q5-hot-start-high-fidelity-dna-polymerase?srsltid=AfmBOop80Al7wMCSK6y6nmUCLZZfeSuqbIcTtPuc1MkG7ohY6MMFtwkQ
	- making hot start master mix using this? we have 5 kits for 500 rxns each 
	- buying 500 rxns of pre-made master mix is $1000+
	- **protocol for making master mix** https://www.neb.com/en-us/protocols/2012/08/30/pcr-using-q5-hot-start-high-fidelity-dna-polymerase-m0493
	- makes 1x master mix, this one is 2x, should I make 2x mm
- also i made a game time decision to index 72 samples instead of 96 (we had the 100 rxn vial and had already used some for index tests and running through the protocol once)
- NEB doesn't recommend comparing PCR with premade mastermix and our mastermix 
	- if i make 2x mastermix and compared them I could use 1.5 kits to finish my samples
	- if not I could 1 kit (with 1x MM) or 2 kits (2x MM)
- [x] send pics of the kit we use for the first PCR
