The Fall of 2023 saw unprecedented high marine temperatures in the Caribbean Sea which caused a massive bleaching event in the region.

Coral bleaching occurs because the coral microbiome changes with increases in oceanic temperatures. Coral polyps live symbiotically with algae and when the temperature increases these algae are rapidly expelled from the coral tissue, leaving a white coral skeleton. 

The tissue can recover provided the temperature goes back down and photo symbionts return to the reef, however, recovery may take weeks to months. If the photo symbionts do not return, corals are subject to death. Upon their death, coral skeletons will be eventually covered by filamentous algae which does not contribute to the symbiotic relationship.

The GW lab observed the detrimental effects of bleaching in collaboration with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Bocas del Toro Panama.
