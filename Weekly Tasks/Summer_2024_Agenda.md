	-  in the omega bio-tek dna extraction kit we use the elution buffer is heated to 65C prior to incubating for 10 minutes, would heating the buffer help maximize eluted DNA?

	- in the omega bio-tek dna extraction kit we use the elution buffer is heated to 65C prior to incubating for 10 minutes, would heating the buffer help maximize eluted DNA
	- would incubating for longer than 10 minutes increase dna 
	-Host DNA
	- why do we mix the beads by flicking during the elution of the host?
	- should we centrifuge for longer if we do not have a centrifuge that goes to 13,000 rpm 
	- if our DNA is going to be sequenced should we be eluting in elution buffer rather than TE buffer?

		Technician
		2022-Present
		B.S. Biology & B.A. Economics, University of Massachusetts Lowell
		My current work is in processing coral samples for metagenomic analysis, and studying the microbiome of Caribbean stony corals. Prior to working as a technician in the lab, I was an undergraduate researcher (UML '24) and studied the impact of thermal bleaching in the Caribbean. Outside of research I enjoy watercolor painting, crocheting and being outside.
