		Technician
		2022-Present
		B.S. Biology & B.A. Economics, University of Massachusetts Lowell
		My current work is in processing coral samples for metagenomic analysis, and studying the microbiome of Caribbean stony corals. Prior to working as a technician in the lab, I was an undergraduate researcher (UML '24) and studied the impact of thermal bleaching in the Caribbean. Outside of research I enjoy watercolor painting, crocheting and being outside.
