	- set up conda, environment file, installed R and got jupyter lab running
	- questions: 
		- now if I want to go into jupyter do I have to always change my pwd to ~opt/miniconda3 and acivate the jupyter environment?
		- based on jupyter lab this info seems like it will be saved in ~/opt/miniconda3, **is this true? if so is this the goal, that it stays located here and can be easily shared?**
		- how does making an environment file make it easier to share my environment?
		- can this easily be transferred into unity?
