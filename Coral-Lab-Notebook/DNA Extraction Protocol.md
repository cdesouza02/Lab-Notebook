Otherwise, follow these steps for coral DNA extraction.

### [](https://github.com/ThijsSt/SCTLD-metagenomes/blob/main/DNA_Extraction.md#preparation)Preparation

-   Heat a heating block/incubator to 70 ◦C, no shaking, put Elution buffer in
-   Heat another incubator to 56 ˚C, light shaking
-   Make sure your P2 buffer is chilled
-   UV Sterilize 3 x # of samples in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes 
-   Make sure HBC buffer and wash buffer are correctly diluted with appropriate chemicals

### [](https://github.com/ThijsSt/SCTLD-metagenomes/blob/main/DNA_Extraction.md#tissue-lysis)Tissue lysis

1.  Weigh approximately 150 – 250 mg of coral sample in an Eppendorf tube or directly into the disruptor tube. Weigh your sample and note down how much sample you’ve processed. (

_The disruptor tube is faster, but you cannot put the sample back if you get too much sample._

2.  Add 725 µL of SLX-Mlus buffer to the disruptor tube. Vortex until the coral skeleton is virtually bare (usually 5-10 minutes).
    
3.  Centrifuge shortly to remove droplets from the lid.
    
4.  Add 72 µL DS buffer to each sample. Incubate at 70 degrees for 5 minutes.
    
5.  Vortex samples briefly.
    
6.  Incubate for another 5 minutes at 70 degrees.
    
7.  Add 3 µL RNAse and incubate for 2-3 minutes at 37 ˚C.
    
8.  Centrifuge at 10000 g/rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature.

9.  Transfer 400 µL supernatant into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Add 135 µL chilled P2 buffer and 200 µL of resuspended cHTR reagent.
    
10.  Centrifuge at 10000 g/rpm for 1 minute at room temperature.
    

_Do not shake the cHTR reagent bottle: this foams it up and barely does anything for the resuspension. Its better to just pipette up and down._

10.  Transfer supernatant to a new centrifuge tube, make sure not to disturb the pellet. Add an equal volume of X1 buffer (about 735 µL)
    
11.  Insert a HiBind column into a 2 mL collection tube. Transfer 700 µL of the sample into the column. Centrifuge at 10000 g/rpm for 1 minute at room temperature. Discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.
    
12.  Repeat step 11 until all filtrate has passed through.
    

### [](https://github.com/ThijsSt/SCTLD-metagenomes/blob/main/DNA_Extraction.md#washing)Washing

13.  Add 500 µL of HBC buffer to the column. Centrifuge at 10000 rpm/g for 1 minute at room temperature. Discard filtrate.
    
14.  Add 700 µL DNA wash buffer to the column. Centrifuge at 10000 rpm/g for 1 minute at room temperature. Discard filtrate.
    
15.  Repeat step 14.
    
16.  Centrifuge the column without loading it with anything for 2 minutes at maximum speed at room temperature.
    

### [](https://github.com/ThijsSt/SCTLD-metagenomes/blob/main/DNA_Extraction.md#elution)Elution

17.  Transfer the column to a clean empty microcentrifuge tube. Add 50 µL elution buffer, heated to 70 ˚C. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
    
18.  Keep the column in the same microcentrifuge tube and add 25 µL elution buffer, heated to 70 ˚C. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.
    
19.  Measure concentration and store DNA at -20 ˚C
