**commonly used for Durusdinium and Breviolum**:
primers psbAFor_1 (5 ́-GCA GCT CAT GGT TAT TTT GGT AGA C-3 ́) and psbARev_1 (5 ́-AAT TCC CAT TCT CTA CCC ATC C-3 ́)


There are other markers of course, such as the cp23s, but that doesn't discriminate between _S. microadriaticum_ and _S. necroappetens_ (which has shown up before only in diseased corals, so I think it's important to be able to observe that! And very cool if you do!)
