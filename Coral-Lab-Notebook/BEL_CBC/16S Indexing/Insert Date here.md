Samples (96)

#### IV. Indexing PCR 
- each sample is indexed with a unique combination of i5 and i7 primers 

using HotStart reagents for this protocol using the following combination of reagents:
- 1uL of pooled product as template in the indexing PCR
- indexing PCR done in 25uL total reaction volume using KAPA Ready Mix

**Steps:**
1. Use strip tubes to create a master mix for each i5 and i7 primer
2. use multi-channel pipette to dispense the master mixes into appropriate tube
	1. add 12uL of each i5 and i7 master mix to each reaction tube - following the template to track the combination of barcodes used for each sample
	2. 12uL i5 master mix + 12uL i7 master mix + 1uL template = 25uL total reaction
3. add DNA to individual reactions 
4. run thermocycler program
