Ho: bleaching and disease have no effect on changes in the coral host microbiome

- Kira recommended against psba next gen as there isnâ€™t a universal primer across genera that works.
	- instead use sanger sequencing to sequence psba products
- caleb
	- lot of inter-generic variation (Senjie Lin has done papers on this, among others)
	- makes it difficult to compare abundance of species using ITS2
	- **Lajuenesse 2022** shows sequencing quality of course affects what gets amplified and shown in the resulting data, and that there's a significant margin of error in the arrangement of the ordering of the ITS2 variants in abundances even when working on the same symbiont lineage.
	- **idea** no one has examined background microbiome contaminants in the water column
	- **sequencing depth of ITS2 20-50K**
	- "universal" Durusdinium psba is commonly used for genus breviolum common in carribean
- sarah davies
	- pool ~120 ITS2 samples in a lane of miseq in a 1:3 concentration ratio with 16S
	- pool 1:3 based on molarity of the separate pools
- andrea suggestions
	- repeated measures for time series 
	- look at agricultural microbiome work for ideas on how to analyze time series 
		- bovine gut microbiome
	- other paper looking at oyster C virginica throughout experiment

**questions I have**
- are coral microbiomes different from their environment
	- they ingest symbionts, can do they choose?
- are coral microbiomes dictated by geographic location
- have coral microbiomes changed over time?
	- have they changed similarly throughout Belize
	- have their been differences during multistressor events
	- how do they cluster based on species and site
