Goal: identify how symbiont communities change over time in different colonies
		colonies that got diseased, died from disease, bleached and recovered, died from bleaching, and stayed healthy throughout 
		how symbionts themselves change over time
	using MCAV and PSTR samples since 2019

Oct 15-19
- Look at coral ITS2 metabarcoding studies and see methods number of reads per sample and or depth of sequencing
	symportal 
- **pull out april2024 data because it is for historical data??** **012024 added new transects**

just focus on 36 rapid corals since 2019 
	PAST, SSID, PSTR, MCAV, OFAV(maybe)
16S 100 samples will all go on one run, so **organize by species?** all in one run? one lane?


positive control  in the lane to normalize the concentrations of symbiont
randomized order of extraction
include some of 2019 suseptible, but only the rapid colonies 

Where to sequence? argonne or utaustin 
	or smithsonian

	diseased margin DNA extractions?? prioritize ssids since they have the most diseased margin?
