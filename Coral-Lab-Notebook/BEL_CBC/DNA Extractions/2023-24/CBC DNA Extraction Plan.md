Goal: identify how symbiont communities change over time in different colonies
		colonies that got diseased, died from disease, bleached and recovered, died from bleaching, and stayed healthy throughout 
		how symbionts themselves change over time
	using MCAV and PSTR samples since 2019
Look at coral ITS2 metabarcoding studies and see methods number of reads per sample and or depth of sequencing

just focus on Brain corals or just on MCAV and PSTR
16S 100 samples will all go on one run, so organize by species

	diseased margin DNA extractions?? prioritize ssids since they have the most diseased margin?
