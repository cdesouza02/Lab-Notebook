two dimers????

#### I. PCR

- **Repeat 3x for all samples that are to be included in the metabarcode library**
- *always include water (negative control - indication of no contamination) and very dilute positive controls (1-5ng of DNA) in every experiment*
- **Mix the following agents via vortex:** Buffer, MgCl2, primers
- **DO NOT vortex:** BSA or Taq
	- Taq should *never* be left at room temperature - **stays in freezer or in freezer box**
- use aliquoted reagents (limits contamination)
- **all PCR prep is done in the bench top hood in the lab***

1. Create master mix for each sample
2. Pipette 25uL of master mix into each replicate tube (3 replicates per sample)
3. Run thermocycler program 16S part 1 HS
	1. 98C for 30S
	2. **28** **cycles of**:
		1. 98C for 10 seconds
		2. 50C for 30 seconds
		3. 72C for 20 seconds
	3. 72C for 2 mins (extension)

### **ALL POST-PCR DONE IN OTHER ROOM (aka the rest of this protocol)**
#### II. Gel electrophoresis
- **always use standard DNA ladder on every row of gel**
- TBE Buffer 'Recipe' https://github.com/jgmcdonough/GW-lab-notebook/blob/main/Protocols/TBE%20Buffer%20Protocol.md
 **Making and setting up a gel:**
- mix agar and clean TBE buffer to generate a 1.5% agarose gel that will be large enough 
- calculating gel density:
	- % = weight (g) / volume (mL)
- melt mixture (on hot plate with stir bar or microwave) until mixture has big bubbles and there's no floaters
	- do not pour into gel rig until flask is cool to touch
	- **add 2 uL GelRed to gel once cool** (if you don't, you won't see your bands!!)
- Add gel comb for number of samples you need
	- pour gel until just underneath where the comb ends
- let gel cool - wells will break if not cooled down enough
- **turn rig so DNA will move towards the positive electrode**
- load 2 uL of DNA ladder (6X; 1:100 dilution) at beginning or end (or both if large rig) of the gel, and on each row
- load 1 uL PCR product 
- put cover on and turn on electric current - **run 110 volts for ~35 mins**
	- check to make sure bands aren't running off the gel
- turn off electric current *then* remove lid
- take picture of gel and save where need
	- turn lights off in room, put gel on the glass and lift the cover (45 degrees) so that there is no reflection from the gel, take photo parallel to gel 
	- editing: crop to be centered, brightness -100

#### III. PCR Pooling
1. using gel images - compare relative brightness of each band for sample replication across all 3 replicates
2. based on comparison - write out required volume to be pooled from each replicate
	1. band brightness generally has 3 levels: bright, faint, absent
	2. when **all bands have the same brightness** (regardless of level): take 5uL from each replicate
		1. Ex. R1 = Bright (5uL), R2 = Bright (5uL), R3 = Bright (5uL)
		2. Ex. R1 = absent (5uL), R2 = absent (5uL), R3 = absent (5uL)
	3. when **all bands are not equal brightness**, then take 10uL from the fainter replicates and pool with 5uL from the bright replicates
		1. Ex. R1 = faint (5uL), R2 = absent (10uL), R3 = absent (10uL)
3. obtain, label, cross-link new strip tubes - appropriate volumes from all 3 replicates are put in the same tube
