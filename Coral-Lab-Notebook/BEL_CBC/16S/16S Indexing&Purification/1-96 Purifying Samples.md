Samples 1-96

## Protocol
#### VI. Purification with ampure beads
obtain, label, and cross-link new strip tubes
start with the manufacturer protocol using 1.8X-1.5X bead ratio and 10uL PCR product
- ratio of beads will change the size you select for 
- 1.5x will get rid of larger primer dimers, 1.8X will get rid of primer dimer below 100 bp

make fresh 80% ethanol in a 50mL tube (label and parafilm when not in use)
	 *may need to re-clean samples if gel images show that multiple bands were not removed*
	 need 39 mL of ethanol for 96 samples
	 
| total volume ml | 50  |
| --------------- | --- |
| volume EtOH     | 40  |
| Volume H2O      | 10  |

1. Determine whether or not a plate transfer is necessary. If the PCR reaction volume multiplied by 2.8 exceeds the volume of the PCR plate, a transfer to larger tubes is required.
2. Gently shake the AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up bottle to resuspend any Magnetic particles that may have settled.  Add  AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up according to the PCR reaction volume table below: PCR Reaction Volume L) AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up Volume at 1.8X ( L) 10 18 20 36 50 90 Note: The volume of AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up for a given reaction can be determined from the following equation:  (Volume of AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean-up per reaction) = 1.8 x (PCR Reaction Volume)

| Bead Volume         |     |               |                   |
| ------------------- | --- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| final concentration | 1.5 |               |                   |
| PCR volume          | 24  | total samples | Total bead volume |
| Added Beads         | 36  | 96            | 3456              |


3. Mix reagent and PCR reaction thoroughly by pipette mixing 5 times.
4. Incubate the mixed samples for 5 minutes at room temperature for maximum recovery. 
	1. This step allows the binding of PCR products 125bp and greater to the Magnetic beads.  After mixing, the color of the mixture should appear homogenous.
	
5. Place the reaction plate onto a 96 well Magnet Plate for 3 minutes or wait until the solution is clear.  Wait until the solution is clear before proceeding to the next washing step. Otherwise there may be beads loss.

6. Aspirate the cleared solution from the reaction plate and discard This step must be performed while the reaction plate is placed on the 96 Magnet Plate. Avoid disturbing the settled Magnetic beads. If beads are drawn into tips, leave behind a few microliters of solution.

7. Dispense 180 L of 80% ethanol to each well of the reaction plate and incubate for 1 min at room temperature.  Aspirate out the ethanol and discard.  Repeat for a total of two washes.  It is important to perform these steps with the reaction plate on a 96 well Magnetic Plate. Do not disturb the settled Magnetic beads. 
	1. Remove all of the ethanol from the bottom of the well to avoid ethanol carryover. **Bump pipette tip up to 200 uL, may need to use p20 multichannel** 
	2. NOTE: A 5 min air dry at room temperature is recommended for the evaporation of the remaining traces of ethanol. Do not overdry the beads (the layer of settled beads appears cracked) as this will significantly decrease elution efficiency.

8. Take off the plate from the Magnetic plate, add 40 uL of elution buffer (Reagent grade water, TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, or TE buffer) to each well of the reaction plate and pipette mix 5 times. 
9. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min
10. Place the plate on a magnetic separation device to magnetize the CleanNGS particles. Incubate at room temperature until the CleanNGS particles are completely cleared from solution. 
11. Transfer the cleared supernatant containing purified DNA and/or RNA to a new (RNase-free) 96-well microplate and seal with non-permeable sealing film. 
12. Store the plate at 2-8°C if storage is only for a few days. For long-term storage, samples should be kept at -20°C.
