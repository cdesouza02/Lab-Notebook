Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit

#### **Selecting the gel electrophoresis voltage**
- A general recommendation is to use 5-10 V for every centimeter of distance between the electrodes in your gel system:

Voltage = distance between the electrodes (cm) x 5-10 V/cm
**small gel:** 11cm* 5-10 V/cm = 55-110V
**medium gel**: 16cm * 5-10 V/cm = 80-160 V
**large gel**: 19 cm * 5-10 V/cm = 95-190 V
- For example, if there are 10 cm between the electrodes, then run at 50-100 V
#### 4/17/2025- Test
test pooling with samples indexed at 60C 

notes- 
- 19 samples pooled together to be extracted 
	- 4,5,6,17-32
- 6X dye means that for 95 uL pool used 15.83 dye needed
- 50 ul of pool fit into each well but some spillage
- ran at 80 V, 50 min+40 min
