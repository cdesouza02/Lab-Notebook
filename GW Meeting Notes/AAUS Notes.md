**Diving Physics**
Things are bigger and louder underwater

Buoyancy
	Speciific Gravity of Water 1, saltwater 1.03 g/ml
	Relative Density=mass of any volume of substance/mass of an equal volume of water
	If RD>1 object sinks
	Upward Force-> buoyant force (volume of object 64lb)
	Downward Force -> weight of obejct
	Make decisions of how much weight needed by using your weight
	
Pressure
	P=Force/Area
	Salt water pessure increases 1 atm per 33 ft (10 m)
	depth gauges and dive computers don’t actually measure depth, rather they measure pressure.
	Absolute Pressure (ATA) = (Depth / Hydrostatic Pressure Constant) + Atmospheric Pressure  ATA = (Depth/ 33) + 1
	_Hydrostatic pressure (saltwater) = Depth / 33_
	Hydrostatic pressure (freshwater) = Depth / 34
	14.7 psi/ATA
	
Gases
	78% Nitrogen
	PV=nRT
	PV/T=PV/T
	pressure and volume have an inverse relationship,
	****P1V1 = P2V2****
	**As we ascend air volumes will expand, this is why you cannot hold your breath**
	pressure change will be _approximately_ 5-6psi per degree F, directly related
	Rankine = Fahrenheit + 459.67

Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15

Partial Pressure 
- Ptotal = absolute pressure = (depth of 33'/33' per atm) + 1 atmosphere of pressure for the air above us = 2.00 ata of pressure
- PO2 = 21% X 2 atm = 0.42 ata 
- PN2 = 78% x 2 atm = 1.56 ata
- Pother = 1% x 2 atm = 0.02 ata
- 40% Nitrox means 40% O2

Henry's Law- gas dissolves into liquid, but continues to cause gas tension pressure
 if the pressure decrease is too rapid or large, we risk bubbles forming.

Dive Tables
	- **Bottom Time** (Also called **Dive Time** on some tables) 
Is considered to be from the start of descent to the start of the ascent. If you spend 20 minutes at 70' and then began your ascent, but took 14 minutes descending to that depth, your total bottom time is 34 minutes.
	-**Cold or Strenuous Dives**
There is evidence that the normal rate of nitrogen uptake and release is affected by cold or high activity levels. For this reason, compute the dive profile for a dive that is cold or arduous by adding the interval specified for your particular table. In some cases, this is adding 10' to the depth, and for other tables, it is an increase in the time.

RNT (Residual Nitrogen Time)+ ABT (Actual Bottom Time)= ESDT (Equivalent Single Dive time) - which can be described as the total nitrogen time from previous dives.

100 no stop limit - 38 residual nitrogen time = **62 minutes of available dive time**

A letter group after a dive is a represenstion of the N in your system

Air Consumption 
	psi rate = (change in pressure(psi)/time (minutes)) / depth (ata)
	**Volume consumption rate = psi consumption rate X (cylinder rated volume/cylinder rated pressure)**
	Example 2
	What is the DCR (Volume) at 84fsw/25.4msw for a diver who an SCR of 0.75 ft3 per minute? 
	Ata = (84fsw+33)/33 = 3.54 ata
	DCR = 0.75ft3 per minute X 3.54 = 2.65 ft3/minute
	If you want to know how many cf per each psi, you can use this equation: volume/pressure

For a 3000psi 80cf cylinder = 80cf/3000psi = 0.026 cf/psi
