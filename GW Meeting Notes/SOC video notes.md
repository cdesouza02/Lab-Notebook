**Intro**
- [x] Caroline: Far below the surface of the Panamanian Atlantic, marine researchers are working to conserve beautiful corals reefs and protect them from imenant threat of disease

- [ ] Video: why coral reefs are so important to marine ecosystem, 


**Explain SCTLD**
- [x] One particular threat, Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease, has been ravaging the Caribbean, leading to unprecedented mortality of corals in at least fifteen countries. After a decade of research, the cause still puzzles marine scientists, who have sought out various treatments for Stony coral tissue loss

- [ ] Video: why is bocas special? it hasnt been exposed to SCTLD yet despite being in proximity to other SCTLD affected areas

**Explain our work**
- [x] One teams approach to this threat is to isolate healthy, disease-resistant coral colonies and split them in a process known as microfragging. These selected colonies are then grown in a land nursery, away from potential exposure to disease and replanted in the reefs once they are able to thrive on their own

**Bocas Mariculture**
- [x] Caroline:  The Sea of Change foundation has facilliated a partnership between marine scientists and a local Panamanian aquaculture organization "Bocas Mariculture". Project Lead Leah Harper says that without the funding from Sea of Change she may not have had the opportunity to work with Till Deuss on this restoration project.
