**Intro**
- [x] Caroline: Far below the surface of the Panamanian Atlantic, marine researchers are working to conserve beautiful corals reefs and protect them from imenant threat of disease

**Explain SCTLD**
- [x] One particular diease, Stony Coral Tissue Loss, has been ravaging the Caribbean, leading to unprecedented mortality of corals in at least fifteen countries. After a decade of research, the cause still puzzles marine scientists, who have sought out various treatments for Stony coral tissue loss

**Explain our work**
- [x] One teams approach to this threat is to isolate healthy, disease-resistant coral colonies and split them in a process known as microfragging. These selected colonies are then grown in a land nursery, away from potential exposure to disease and replanted in the reefs once they are able to thrive on their own
