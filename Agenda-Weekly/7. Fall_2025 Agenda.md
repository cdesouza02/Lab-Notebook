Nov 22-24
personal
- [x] apply to UCONN job
- [x] umass dartmouth job
data analysis
- [x] send out ITS2 (tues afternoon)
- [ ] heatmap to look at common asvs(wed)
- [x] upset plot with monthyear (tues)
- [x] commit changes to github (tues)
- [x] dada2 with split dada and new filtering parameters (tues)
	-  more reads than split_reads with discard_untrimmed
	- convert dada2 into an r script
- [ ] order positive controls, the ones erin sent?

Nov 14-16
- [x] notes for cutadapt re-run
	- higher quality reads when I use discard-untrimmed (less amount of initial reads but that is okay for now)
	- checked the lower quality reads, there are only 18 samples that have over 10K reads
- [x] post issue on dada2 git
- [x] cybersecurity training

sampling 
Sankey graphs- immune timepoints, even though fewer corals 
investigate my taxa now, do not extrapolate AT ALL
finalize taxa figures (thurs)

- [ ] rerun trimming cutadapt but do R1 separate from R2 
	- bc they are separate files!!
- LOok at slurm!!, also does the seq file get smaller
Nov 2-7
- [ ] Date_PCR and number of reads relationship??
- [x] cut the n's off 
	- just bioinformatically cut the n's out
	- cutadapt to cut off everything before the adapter 
	- sequencer demulipexed- cut off indexing sequencing adapter
	- take just the 16S primer, cut off anything before that 
- [ ] look at what is different in both pasts 
	- is there overlap in asvs (venndiagram for 2 coral @ 2 timepoints)
	- exploratory statistics, im gonna add more samples
	- what are the microbes that are staying the same through time?
		- individuals?
		- species?
- [x] dada2/phyloseq on cutadapt trims
	- verify that cutadapt trimmed primers off
- [ ] cutadapt
	- split_reads: still has primer
	- trimmed_reads: does not have primer
	- reads-still: has primer, *but did it trim off the N's properly*?
	- **Hmm yeah can you look at them and see if they have everything before the primers cut off?**

Oct 14-18
- [x] apply for tech position in Lisa's lab
	- [x] add to networking drive
- [x] jade pcr (tues)
- [x] art for poster
- [x] scratch3 extension
- [x] start CERF presentation
- [x] trying to map out nested clusters (wed)
	- figured out that hierarchical clusters won't work for my results bc there is overlapping in the nesting
	- switch gears to OHC
- [ ] bio retreat poster
- [x] remove "Date_16S " run analysis that way
- [ ] patterns with Date_16S?? 2_25 and 3_6
	- amount of reads?
	- Taxomony?? order, phylum
	- Run DEseq2 with df of cluster 1 and cluster 2 
			- LOOKS for diff in asv based on cluster 1 and cluster 2
			- don't need nmds info there 
	- new df by species
		- top 100 of asvs
		- plots by species 
		- facet by colony 
		- family

- [ ] *do the sequences start with 16S primer? where did the barcodes go?*
	- *~~1. run dada2 on untrimmed 16S~~*
	- *2 run dada2 on more agressive trimming same filt*
	- *3. more agressive trimming (same as step 2) less agressive filtering in dada2*
