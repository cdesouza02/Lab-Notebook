- [ ] ITS2 PCR (tues,wed, thurs, fri)
- [ ] are there certain samples to pull out from ITS2 analysis to do psba? some from each species to make it clearer?


Jan 12-16
- [x] 16S gels (tues)
- [x] non-immune PCR spreadsheet (tues)
	- [ ] randomize with two more runs
- [x] run gel with brandon (wed)
- [ ] requibit 1st 16S and ITS pools, send after confirming last sequncing run went well 
- [ ] ITS2 bare minimum analysis 
	- did it work? do we need to resequence?
	- read other papers on ITS2 analysis 
	- **what do I need to download from its2 resources?**
- [ ] ~~Download 2nd round of sequences,~~ 
	- did the 1:3 molarity work?
	- do the stats and nmds/pca look normal?
- [ ] send ITS2 round 2 to symportal (fri)

Jan 5-9
- [x] reclean 16S pool
	- double check calculations
- [x] send out 16S:ITS2 pool (mon)
- [x] switch over to 3rd set of samples (tues)
- [x] how many samples and get a balanced number from each species (tues)
	- what an equivalent number of colonies 
	- how many colonies from 2019 +2022, and try to get the same number of colonies that were diseased in 2022
- [x] 16S PCR(wed, thurs, fri)
